For this problem, I knew I had to use prefix sum, or at least do some pre-work; which was obvious because of O(1) time complexity required by this problem.
I first tried to store prefix of rows and columns separately and calculate the sum using those, but the solution became way too complex and I also needed to use a loop in the end XD
So I peeked at the YT video in the Solution section and everything became clear once the core idea was explained.
Although I feel like I need to come back to this problem and re-solve it.
